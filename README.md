# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning-based approach to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest on the Wisconsin dataset.

A machine learning-based project to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using various supervised learning algorithms on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

This project implements classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict breast cancer diagnosis. The model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
